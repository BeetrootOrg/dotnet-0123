    <h1>Hi there! My name is Bohdan Teplytskyi.</h1>
    <p>And I'm studying at the Beetroot Academy. I'm planning to be a ASP.NET Developer.
        <b>Why?</b> Because i love money. <br>
    I'm kidding, I wanna be ASP.NET Developer because I always liked technology and everything about it.<br>
    I do like the last part of the course beacuse it's exactly what I wanted from this it. Also the teacher is a talanted man that knows how to explain complex things in simple terms. </p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>oh, and here is our teacher</td>
            <td>oh, and here is me (but around 10 years ago)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img class="rounded-img" src="misik.png" alt="Dmytro Misik - The teacher ">
            </td>
            <td>
                <img class="rounded-img" src="me.jpg" alt="My photo ">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>So, <a href="http://www.google.com/">here</a> is a link to Google. Hopefully it works when you're watching this.</p>
